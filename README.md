- Hello, I'm **Aaron Tartz**.
- I'm graduating with a B.S. in **Computer Engineering** at **San Diego State University** in Spring 2025.
- I'm pursuing an M.S. in **Communication Theory & Systems** at UCSD in Fall 2025.
- I'm highly interested in exploring methods to bridge **machine learning** with **communication technology** to work toward intelligence-endogenous 6G networks (ML for network control, resource management, etc) and enable key advancements in applications such as IIoT, autonomous driving, and smart cities.
- I currently work as an **undergraduate researcher** under the guidance of Dr. Baris Aksanli, funded by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at San Diego State University.
- My research experience includes the topics of **adversarial machine learning** and **hyperdimensional computing**.
